Lagan Unit Tests
================

PHP Unit is installed by Composer.

To run all tests:
`$ vendor/bin/phpunit tests`



What are we testing?
--------------------

We're testing the Lagan project. It has quite a few dependencies, like the Lagan core and the different Lagan properties.

The example Lagan Models should use all these dependencies. So by testing them we're testing the dependencies as well.
